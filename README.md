# Soda Machine
This is a project I worked on for Honors Intro to Engineering. 
All parts of this project were created soley by myself. Some of the 
code (such as executable JAR files, .js and .java files) for the project is not shown since I do not want to relase it publicly as it contains private keys and I do not want other people copying my work, but the final presentation
is included. 
This project was made using Arduino, Raspberry PI (Debian), Android, Tizen OS, Firebase, and Clarifai in a variety of languages. 
To understand what the project was about and what
technologies were involved, please view the presentation. (Click View Raw On The .pptx file to download the presentation).
If you have any questions, or would like me to explain the project, please contact me at:

### **In the presentation there is a demonstration video that shows the project in action.**
